              Hello, I'm Abdessamad Dadda, a full stack developer and currently a third-year student in a Bachelor's program in Web and Mobile Development. 
              I hold a DTS from ISTA NTIC Rabat and a diploma in entrepreneurship, which reinforces my ability to manage projects from both a technical and strategic perspective.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-300">
              I have worked on a variety of real-world projects, including educational platforms and e-commerce sites. 
              My development approach blends clean design, performance, and usability, with a constant focus on learning and improving.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-300">
              Iâ€™ve studied and practiced with many technologies such as PHP, AngularJS, Python, Flutter, Django, Microsoft Azure, Node.js, JavaScript, React, Laravel, Vue.js, and more.
